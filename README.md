# Debian DevSystem
scripts to turn your linux desktop into a java dev environment up and running in seconds

## Scope
The scripts are designed to work for me in my current working environment ... feel free to get inspired, but don't expect the scripts to work under any circumstances...

## Tested
- Linux Mint 21 (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
- Nemo (Mint Cinnamon File Browser) specific extensions...

## How to use
1. clone or download this repo into your user home (e.g. /home/rew/debianDevSystem)
2. run a cool composite installer script `debAdmin.sh`, `debCommunicator.sh` or `debEnv.sh`
3. manually add the line `export PATH=$PATH:/home/rew/debianDevSystem/bin` to `~/.bashrc`.
4. optionally copy the `.bash_aliases` file into your user home dir.
5. use the installed tools...
